| Marriage Logic Gate                |
|------------------------------------|
|Husband |Wife    ||Result           | 
|------------------------------------|
|Wrong   |Right   ||Wife is right    |
|Right   |Right   ||Wife is right    |
|Right   |Wrong   ||Wife is right    |
|Wrong   |Wrong   ||husband is wrong |

But table still difficult to read, so a day I decided to code an app that can help men in this case.
And what is better than an AI to carry out this mission? Your wife, but if you ask her, she could leave you.
You don't want to be single. So an AI is the key to living a lasting love relationship.
Don't worry, it's very simple to use.

Firstly:
Launch marriage-logic-gate.py and use the function generate_network() to create the AI once it's finished, you can go to the step two

Secondly:
Run the who_is_right_or_wrong (husband, wife) function, you have to replace husband and wife by 0 or 1, it's simple 0 for wrong and 1 for right.
For example, your right and your wife is wrong, so you type "who_is_right_or_wrong (1, 0)"
